# 🏛️ Interactable 3D Environment (raylib/C)

This repository contains a simple interactive 3D environment built in C using the **raylib** library.

The program initializes a fullscreen window, loads a static 3D model (`City_1.glb`), and allows the user to navigate the scene in first-person mode.

---

## ✨ Features

* **First-Person Control:** Uses standard WASD keys for movement and mouse input for looking around.
* **3D Model Loading:** Demonstrates loading and drawing a GLB model (`resources/City_1.glb`).
* **Fullscreen Mode:** Initializes the application in fullscreen for a better immersive experience.
* **Optimized:** Uses a fixed target FPS of 80.

## 🛠️ Build and Run Instructions (Linux/Ubuntu/Mint)

This project requires the **raylib** library and its dependencies to be installed on your system. Since raylib is not always available in standard repositories, the process involves installing necessary graphics headers and then compiling the raylib library from source.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/AbhinekDangi03/Interactable_3D_environment.git](https://github.com/AbhinekDangi03/Interactable_3D_environment.git)
cd Interactable_3D_environment
